# Olvetti Faces Case Study
The dataset contains a set of images taken between April 1992 and 1994 at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.
The data includes ten different images of each of 40 distinct people. The images were taken at a different time and with varying lights, with different facial expression (open/closed eyes, smiling/not smiling) and with/without glasses. All the images were taken against a dark background with the people in an upright, frontal position.

The goal here is to train the SVM classification model to identify the recognise the labels (identifying the people) based on the images.
